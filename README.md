1.CRUD operations using the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE in .NET Core
2.Storing our entities and save our changes in a SQL Server database with Entity Framework Core. Code-first migration for that.
3.Authentication to our web service. Users have to register and authenticate to get access to their data.
4.How to hash a password and verify it again, but we also implemented the use of JSON web tokens. With the help of that token, the user doesnâ€™t have to send her credentials with every call. The token does the job for us.
5.Covered advanced relationships in Entity Framework Core and the SQL Server database. Implemented one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
6.Reository Pattern
